## Philosophy

![](images/datafest.png){style="float: right; padding-left: 20px;" fig-alt="Photo with two students from Duke DataFest 2023" fig-align="right" width="250"}

Prior to my time at Duke, I've taught multiple sections of Introductory and Intermediate Statistics at Montana State, developed their Intermediate Statistics online course, and helped integrate R into the Introductory Statistics curricula. I prioritize community, communication, and respect in my classroom. I want to provide a space where we can freely talk about the material, embrace mistakes, and learn together throughout the semester.

-   Introduction & Intermediate Data Science Courses
-   Introduction & Intermediate Statistics and Data Analysis Courses
-   Introductory and Advanced Data Visualization in R
-   Data Literacy
-   Spatial Data Analysis
