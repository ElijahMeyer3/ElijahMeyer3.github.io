# Philosophy

![](datafestpic.png){width="250" height="320" fig-align="center"}

Prior to my time at Duke, I've taught multiple sections of Introductory and Intermediate Statistics at Montana State, developed their Intermediate Statistics online course, and helped integrate R into the Introductory Statistics curricula. I prioritize community, communication, and respect in my classroom. I want to provide a space where we can freely talk about the material, embrace mistakes, and learn together throughout the semester.
