Currently, I am in the process of creating a Data Science specialization course for Coursera, and am co-authoring a paper *Introductory Data Science: A Blueprint to Navigate Curricular, Pedagogical, and Computational Challenges* that provides a flexible blueprint for instructors to develop or redesign an introductory data science course to include a variety of technologies while simultaneously discussing how to navigate challenges such as large class sizes, and technology integration.
