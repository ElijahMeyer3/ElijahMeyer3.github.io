> Data Carpentry\'s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (\~ 6 hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting. The last lesson demonstrates how to work with databases directly from R.
