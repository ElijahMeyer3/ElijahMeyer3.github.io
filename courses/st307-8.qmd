[Course coordinator since Spring 2025](coming soon)

> Course coordinator of large service introductory SAS and R courses that seat roughly 700 students. These courses are taught by teaching assistants (TA). These courses combine lecture from the TAs, and virtual teaching components (videos; walkthroughs; in-class assessments) prepared by me. Coordinating this course includes weekly meetings with all TAs to discuss pedagogy and course content.
